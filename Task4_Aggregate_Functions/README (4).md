# Task 4 â€“ Aggregate Functions and Grouping

# Objective
Use SQL aggregate functions like 'COUNT', 'AVG', 'SUM', along with 'GROUP BY' and 'HAVING' to summarize data.

# What I Did
- Counted total books and members using 'COUNT(*)'
- Calculated average published year using 'AVG' and 'ROUND'
- Counted books per category and loans per member using 'GROUP BY'
- Used 'HAVING' to filter groups (e.g., members with more than 1 loan)
- Grouped by 'Returned' to show how many books were returned or not
- Joined tables to count total books written by each author
