# Task 5 â€“ SQL Joins

# Objective
Use different types of SQL joins to combine and analyze data from multiple tables.

# What I Did
- Performed INNER JOIN to list books with their categories
- Used LEFT JOIN to fetch all books and their authors (even if no authors)
- Demonstrated RIGHT JOIN to list all members and their loans
- Simulated FULL OUTER JOIN using UNION on books and loans
- Applied SELF JOIN to find members with the same membership date
- Used CROSS JOIN to show all book-category combinations
- Used JOIN without foreign key using intermediate mapping table
- Used NATURAL JOIN equivalent for clean joins using common keys
